# MachineLearning

Welcome to my personal space for learning Machine Learning — a journey of curiosity, persistence, and growth.

This repository is both a learning journal and a shared resource. Here, I’ll collect:

📚 Book notes and key concepts

🔍 Research findings and ideas

💻 Hands-on projects and experiments

But beyond the content, this repo represents a commitment to consistency — a promise to keep learning every day, no matter how small the effort.

Some days might be filled with hours of coding, reading, and exploration. Other days might just be a few minutes of reflection or a single concept learned. The goal isn’t perfection, but persistence. Every small step adds up over time.

By sharing this journey publicly, I aim to hold myself accountable and inspire others who are learning too. If you’re curious about Machine Learning or starting your own path, I hope this space encourages you to stay consistent and enjoy the process.
